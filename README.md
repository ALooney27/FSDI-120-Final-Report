# FSDI-120-Final-Report

For my project I ended up creating an informative page for a concrete company. The page has 4 pages, it has a home page, an about page, a services page, and a contact page. Each page serves their own purpose and informs possible customers of available services, along with showing samples of previous work.

The functionalities that the project has are email services. On the contact page, possible clients have the opportunity to send the company their information along with a brief message informing the company about questions that they may have for a project that they have been trying to have done. On the services page there is another email service that is more for the type of client who already knows what it is that they are trying to have done for their next project, and they have the opportunity to select from a list of choices for what it is that they want to have done.
